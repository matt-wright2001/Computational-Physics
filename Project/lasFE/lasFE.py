## lasFE is developed to facilitate a statistical analysis of particle-size distribution (PSD) data collected with a TSI model 3340A Laser Aerosol Spectrometer (LAS) to determine the Filtration Efficiency (FE) of nuclear-grade High Efficieny Particlulate Air (HEPA) filters at a specified particle diameter for qualification or performance-evaluation purposes. Data collection is controlled by ICET test procedure for measuring FE. To estimate FE, lasFE shall perform a nonlinear fit to the lognormal distribution on the upstream and downstream PSD and calculates the penetration (P) as a ratio of the aerosol concentration before and after filtration. FE is related to penetration through the relationship, FE = 1 - P.

## User interaction with lasFE is facilatated through YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) configuration files. These files contain necessary information to process the data such as aerosol-sample numbers and instrumental parameters.

## This version of lasFE has been developed for PH 6433 Computational Physics at MSU. This project is not subject to ASME-NQA-1 nor ICET-QA-036, Software Control, quality assurance requirements. For this reason, this software shall not be used for any purpose other than PH 6433.
